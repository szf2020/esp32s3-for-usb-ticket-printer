# esp32s3-for-usb-ticket-printer
Esc Pos Usb printer with Esp32S3

The code that finally worked doesn't rely on a "library" in the traditional Arduino sense (like something you download from a Library Manager). 
Instead, it uses the Native ESP-IDF USB Host Stack.

Why this approach worked while others failed?:

Hardware Directness: 

Most Arduino USB libraries are written for external chips (like the MAX3421E). This code, at change,  talks directly to the internal USB engine of the ESP32-S3.

Interface Claiming: 

The point is the use of "usb_host_interface_claim". USB devices are protective; they won't accept data until a Host explicitly "claims" the interface.

Endpoint Discovery: 

By manually scanning the descriptors, we stopped "guessing" if the printer was on address 1 or 2 and let the esp32s3 find the correct path.

Key Components of the code script:

usb_host_install Powers on the USB hardware inside the ESP32-S3.

usb_host_client_register Creates a "listener" for when you plug/unplug the cable.

usb_host_interface_claim Locks the printer so it only listens to your ESP32.

usb_host_transfer_submit Pushes the ESC/POS bytes through the wire to the thermal head.
